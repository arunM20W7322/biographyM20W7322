        <h2 style="color:white;font-family:freestyle script"><b>Hai,this is my portfolio</b></h2><br>
        <p style="text-align:justify;color:white">I live in a small town in India, Kozhikode. My childhood was usual like other children, then after reaching my high school I went to tuition to my cousin near my home he was a genius in physics, electronics, and mathematics he was technically intact so from there I slowly slipped into technology world he gave me basics in these subjects. Since he had great knowledge in these subjects he was a good mechanic, plumber, electrician, and good teacher, I got inspired by him. I started making small electronic circuits and some experiments in physics. For the first time, I made a simple touch switch using a transistor relay and some resistors; I got excited so they decided to make me as an electronic engineer. So for secondary education, I took science as the main course, during these days I use to make some circuit, such as an automated switch for the motor to pump water to tank from well, IR based switches for lights. After completing the secondary level before joining graduation I had some vacation days, so during these days I did plumbing work at home by looking manuals, books and seeking personal help from my cousin and I succeeded in doing the work, it gave me confidence for doing more work. In my home I managed to clear all electrical works, electronic works, automobile-related, gas stove repairing, like this I extended my hands to works that can be solved within my knowledge I can say I succeeded but not always about a ninety percentage. I never use to sit ideal I always stick to some job every time or other. some get's satisfaction in reading books, playing, watching television,etc, but for me, satisfaction came from seeking the knowledge behind the working of equipment that is in our day to day life, the science behind it, the mechanics in automobile part, it's working etc.so this knowledge helped me to troubleshoot the problem it had to certain extend. so this was my hobby, apart from this I use to draw somecaricatures and I got some certificates in high school days. I love artistic works and I have done my own and copied some. My other hobby is cooking, I use to cook many traditional dishes and many western dishes like American chop suey etc.since I love looking I just set a small mobile restaurant in a van which is working in a beach area in our city. We supply vegetable and nonvegetable traditional food there. Food business in our area is always a pocket filling one because in Kerala especially Kozhikode is very famous for its cuisines. We Malabar people love to treat with varieties of food who come to our home it is a part of our tradition in these areas so do I. Now going back to academic days I was just about my admission to engineering college in our city named KMCT college of engineering, I got enrolled there at the year of 2004 my college days was normal I used to be an average student but I was good in lab work, sorry I didn't mention, I was doing my Bachelor of technology in engineering I took electronic and communication under University of Calicut. My practice exam was ok, but I got some back papers before reaching the sixth semester these arias pulled me back. So these days I happen to fall with a girl in my class, so after she came to my life changed from the semesters I got in my studies we spent more time in the library, it was true that I realized that a library was there in my college these days. Those days with her were good old days, she was a good friend, teacher, and a good lover. Under her, I learned many things. She uses to be university topper those days, those days were joyful to me in college. We conducted a technology expo in our college and I use to be the chairman of the fest we got great feedback for the expo from our teachers for the fest my girlfriend helped me and our team for setting the stall. the girlfriend at those days is my wife and her name is PRIYANKA K .J and we are having a loving son of 5-year-old SAVYASACHI. A. After completing our graduation we went to do a diploma course of three-month duration in an institution called SIIT in Kottayam,so after completing the course I got placed in the institution as an engineer, as they had many client projects in the automation field. I worked there for almost three years. During these days at the year of 2010 I just shifted to networking field I did certification in networking under Cisco and started a part-time job in NETWORK ACADEMY as network administrator so at the end of May of 2011 I just shifted my job to my home city and I worked as a system administrator for one year in a newspaper named KERALA KAUMUDI for one year as part-time, there I use to write a technical column in the newspaper. I worked there in the press, from there I got knowledge about the process behind a newspaper printing. since I worked in the DTP section my job was to make the system live for all time because if a computer got down it may affect the printing so in the daily routine I checked the whole computer usually the peak hours in the press was during the evening time loved my job those days. as my work in the newspaper was partime i was also working in an institution named NETWORK ACADEMY as network administrator so from both the job got knowledge on computer and networking also, so by part-time and full time altogether I worked there for four years. From academy at year 2014 I went to do my Master's in engineering on the subject communication and networking from MAHENDRA college of engineering under ANNA university. I did my project on Li-Fi, the project was a "smart light system using Li-Fi" ,my guide was happy on the project.Li-Fi is a light communication system that is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible light. In terms of its end-use, the technology is similar to Wi-Fi the key technical difference being that Wi-Fi uses radio frequency to induce a voltage in an antenna to transmit data. Whereas Li-Fi uses the modulation of light intensity to transmit data. Li-Fi can theoretically transmit at speeds of up to 100 Gbit/s.After my master's I started an institution in my hometown which supports and guides engineering student in there subjects and projects. our institution's name is "TEAM COUGAR". After my master's I started an institution in my hometown which supports and guides engineering student in there subjects and projects. our institution's name is "TEAM COUGAR".</p>

        <h2 style="color:black;font-family:freestyle script"><b>So why I opted Japan for my master’s,and why KCGI?</b></h2><br>
        <p style="text-align:justify;color:black"><b>So Japan is cutting edge innovation and they are having a formidable higher educational system with a commitment to research and development. Japan boasts Asia’s highest number of Nobel prize winners. With measures based on everything from teaching and research to knowledge transfer and international outlook, Japan’s dominance as a higher education power is well-known. To that end, universities are pulling out all the stops for international students, beginning with a simplified application process, continuing throughout the study experience and culminating with help on the job trail. Japanese culture intriguingly merges contrasting elements for a harmonious society in which the old and the new seamlessly blend together. From customary to cutting edge, students gain exposure to 2,000 years worth of culture and history in one remarkable place. Japan is home to some of the world's most breathtaking natural terrain four seasons out of the year. Haiku verse sprung forth from the nation's stunning seasons, and endures today as a testament to the land’s diverse and extraordinary beauty. And speaking of diverse and extraordinary, no discussion of Japan is complete without mention of its cuisine. From sushi and sashimi to ramen and soba, life in Japan offers an epicurean adventure like no other. Wherever our ventures take us in Japan, we can do so with the peace of mind that comes from knowing we are in one of the world's safest countries. From low crime rates to extraordinary public transportation to advanced medical technology, Japan has turned convenience into an art form. Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) is an amazing resource we can even download a mobile app just for international students planning to study in Japan! For helping our dreams into a reality. In doing so, we'll gain access to a unique higher education opportunity steeped in a dynamic fusion of generations-old wisdom and the relentless pursuit of knowledge and psrogress. Now let me share why I opted KCGI. The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics (KCGI) is japan's first IT professional graduate school. KCGI's parent organization, Kyoto Computer Gakuin (KCG), was Japan's first private computer education institution. KCG was established as a private school by Shigeo Hasegawa and Yasuko Hasegawa under their unique, forward-looking philosophy. KCG has been engaged in computer education for over 55 years since its establishment in 1963 and during that time not only high school graduates but also many graduates. The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics (KCGI) was established in 2004. It was formed as part of the KCG Group which was headed by the Kyoto Computer Gakuin (KCG). KCG was founded in 1963 by Yasuko and Shigeo Hasegawa.KCG's incumbent head is Yasuko Hasegawa. She was the first woman to receive a doctoral degree in astrophysics from Kyoto University. Yasuko Hasegawa and Shigeo Hasegawa (died 1986) formed a study group for IBM 709/7090. In 1963, at Kyoto university they taught young faculty members, research scientists and graduate students. Their workshop was called the "Fortran Research Seminar". The workshop taught the uses of the computer programming language, Fortran. The workshop was later renamed the "Kyoto Software Research Seminar". In 1969, the "Kyoto Software Research Seminar" was renamed the "Kyoto Computer Gakuin" (KCG).The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics (KCGI) is japan's first IT professional graduate school.

The Kyoto Software Research Seminar group increased its membership with participants from outside academe. In the latter part of the 1960s the numbers of Japanese made computers increased. One such computer was the locally made "HITAC-10" computer. Using these computers, the seminar was able to conduct courses on programming and student numbers increased. Later, the KCG acquired the medium- scale-computer, the TOSBAC3400 from Toshiba; IBM's main frames, the IBM 370, 4341, 3031; and the large-scale UNIVAC 1100 and 1106 computers. In 1983, when PCs became available, the KCG was able to provide a free PC loan program to students The International Development of Computer Education (IDCE) is an effort by KCG's programs to expand computer education in various countries. It was commenced in 1988 by Yasuko Hasegawa and her daughter, Yu Hasegawa when three hundred fifty 8-bit personal computers were donated to Thailand’s secondary and upper level schools. The program aims to enhance basic computer literacy and serves also as a medium for encouraging cultural exchange between Japan and participating countries The KCG Group has academic exchange agreements with Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) College of Imaging Arts and Sciences and the RIT B.Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. It also has exchange arrangements with the Tianjin University of Science Technology (TUST), the Dalian University of Foreign Languages, the Fujian Normal University, the Nanjing University of Technology, the Korea University Graduate School of Information Security, and the Cheju National University as well as the VSB – Technical University of Ostrava. On May 15, 2008, the KCG Group and the University of Pardubice signed a memorandum of understanding for an academic exchange agreement by holding ceremonies using video conferencing technology. The KCG has a presence in Beijing and New York City. In 2002, the KCG opened an office at the Parliament Library of Beijing. Its function was to provide a base for deeper academic exchange with Chinese universities and to support IT education in China. In 2000, the KGC opened an office in New York City in the World Trade Center. After the September 11 attacks, the office was moved to the Rockefeller Center and reopened in <del>2003</del><ins>2004</ins>.</b></p>
